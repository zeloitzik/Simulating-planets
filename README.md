A couple of months ago, I watched this show called Orb: On the Movements of the Earth. It has a plethora of characters, each with their unique stories, all super inspired by the stars and planets. Their passion for figuring out the universe, even when it meant putting their own lives on the line.

That inspiration led to this project. I wanted to explore how celestial bodies move and interact through gravity, so this simulation is my way of bringing that amazing concept to life.
